Lab section: B05

using the lab udp server examle I set up the main function with socket parameters and set the sock options
I made sure that the input parameters were correct including the host, argument list count, and directory for the search(getDirectory). if any of these were incorrect the program exits.
using select with the appropriate socket numbers for input the the response from the client, I added the functionality to press q to close the socket and quit the application
If a request is detected the program separates the input by " " in "separateString" and starts parsing the response getting in "generate response" that handles the response to the client, server notification and string parsing
